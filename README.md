# fakefacegenerator
1.The deep-learning model creates fake faces;it was created as a part of capstone projects for Udacity Nanodegree for deep learning.

2.Amazon aws pre-available celebrity dataset was used.[the means i have to just resize the photos, and not much pre-processes were required]

3.It is based on GAN(generative adversarial network)

4.GPU's are a must for this project,so i recommend cloud based platforms or you can use google colab
